  Let R (x y: X): Prop := m x < m y.

  Fact Acc_measure : well_founded R.
  Proof. unfold R; apply wf_inverse_image, lt_wf. Qed.

Extraction Inline measure_rect measure_double_rect.

(** Solved the parasitic let/in issue with measure_rect with the black magic 
    Ltac hack that constructs the fixpoint and then hides it 

    This is a kind of inlining of measure_rect & measure_double_rect inside
    the Coq terms instead of inlining them at extraction.

    Beware that [define] below will not work well if "fresh" variable names
    clash with hyps x and y ... not sure of the exact semantics of Ltac ...

    I agree this inlining is ugly but I am not able to remove the let/in
    by using measure_rect ...
